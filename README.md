# IDSafe-app

## Overview

IDSafe is a blockchain-based identity verification system designed for refugees. It uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to manage identity verification across different blockchains. The system enables access to essential services like healthcare, education, and financial assistance through verified digital credentials.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management**: Each refugee is assigned a unique DID to manage their identity securely.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Chainlink CCIP enables seamless identity verification across multiple blockchain networks.
- **Credential Issuance and Verification**: Refugees receive verifiable credentials as NFTs, which can be used to prove their identity.
- **Event Emission**: Emits events for credential issuance and cross-chain verification, ensuring transparency and traceability.

## Chainlink Integration

Chainlinkâ€™s CCIP is used for cross-chain identity verification. Specifically:
- **Cross-Chain Verification**: Emits a verification event for identity validation on different chains.
- **Oracles**: Chainlink oracles send verification requests and process responses securely.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **CrossChainInteroperability.sol**: Handles cross-chain identity verification requests.
- **IdentityVerification.sol**: Manages on-chain verification.
- **Hypercert.sol**: Issues identity credentials as NFTs.
- **ReputationSystem.sol**: Tracks reputation for each user.
